Working with Nishtha as our Product Manager has been exceptional. She deeply understands our product and works seamlessly with our tech lead to prioritize features that deliver real business value. Her fresh ideas and proactive communication keep projects moving forward smoothly, and she excels at cross-functional collaboration across all teams.

Nishtha has a remarkable ability to translate strategy into actionable JIRA tasks while maintaining sprint velocity and meeting deadlines consistently. She stays close to user needs through continuous research and feedback, ensuring we build the right things. What sets her apart is how she combines strong execution with genuine care for the team â€“ she's always willing to help others succeed.

Her contributions have significantly impacted our team's success, and working with her has been a highly positive experience.



If I had to identify areas where Nishtha could be even more effective, they're really extensions of her strengths. She's so humble and team-focused that she rarely takes credit for her wins - I'd love to see her be more vocal about her achievements since her strategic decisions have driven so many of our successes. Similarly, because she's so capable, she ends up handling everything herself. While she executes flawlessly, sharing more of the workload could help others grow and prevent her from burning out. Finally, her bias toward action means she jumps on every problem immediately. This proactive approach is great, but sometimes letting smaller issues sit would free her up for the strategic work where she adds the most value. These aren't real weaknesses - just ways she could better leverage her considerable talents.
